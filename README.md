# arc-3 — games catalog + internal run evaluation

Two things live in this repo, and they share one site (**https://arc3.sonpham.net**):

1. **Games** — a browsable, playable catalog of ~300 ARC-AGI-3 games: the 25 official
   ARC Prize Foundation games, our in-house custom games, and the Red Blue Pill community
   catalog. Public, no login, runs entirely in the browser.
2. **Internal runs** — the evaluation side: every benchmark run we've done of the
   ARC-AGI-3 duck harness, with a scoreboard, a per-turn run inspector, resource usage,
   and score-distribution ("signal") runs. Behind sign-in.

Everything under `docs/` is that site; everything else is the machinery that produces it —
the harness variants, the GCP launch kit, and the raw run logs.

---

## 1. Games

`docs/index.html` — the public half of the site.

**294 games in the catalog**, from three sources that all share the same
`environment_files/<code>/<version>/` layout and the same `ARCBaseGame` / `arcengine`
model:

| Source | Count | Origin |
|---|---:|---|
| `official` | 25 | the public ARC-AGI-3 games (`environment_files/` in this repo) |
| `custom` | 17 | built in-house (sibling repo `arc-agi-3`) |
| `redbluepill` | 252 | [theredbluepill/arc-interactive](https://github.com/theredbluepill/arc-interactive) |

Game *codes* collide across sources (`cr01`, `ft09`, `ls20`, `pt01`, `vc33` exist in more
than one catalog as entirely different games), so everything keys on the full `game_id`
with its version suffix (`ft09-0d8bbf25` vs `ft09-9ab2447a`) — never the bare code.

### How play works

Click a game and it runs **the real Python game** in your browser: Pyodide (WASM CPython +
numpy) in a Web Worker, with `arcengine`'s wheel pulled straight from PyPI and unzipped into
site-packages. The only thing fetched from us is the game's `.py` source text. Nothing is
sent to a server, nothing is recorded, there's no login and no leaderboard.

- Controls: WASD/arrows to move, `r` reset, `z` = ACTION5, `x`/`c` = ACTION7, click = CLICK.
- Undo, per-level jump strip, FPS control, live status/score.
- **Tile render modes** (`docs/static/games/arc_tiles.py`): `solid` is the engine's stock
  nearest-neighbour upscale; `tiles` gives every palette colour a fixed deterministic motif
  so a cell reads as an object with a texture rather than a flat blob; `random` reshuffles
  both motif and colour assignment per episode from a seed — behaviour untouched, appearance
  not, so an agent can't carry "blue == wall" across episodes. Same board, same rules.

The 16-colour board palette is deliberately duplicated between the thumbnail generator
(`scripts/build_games_manifest.py`) and the play page (`docs/static/js/games-play.js`), so
in-browser play renders pixel-identical to the static thumbnails and to recorded runs.

### Rebuilding the catalog

```bash
python scripts/build_games_manifest.py    # manifest.json + per-game src/ + thumbnails
```

Writes `docs/static/games/manifest.json`, `docs/static/games/src/<game_id>/<file>.py`, and
`docs/static/img/games/<game_id>.png`. Needs `arcengine` installed (for thumbnails and
tile-scale detection). Six titles are currently parked in `TEMPORARILY_REMOVED_CODES` —
their source and thumbnails stay on disk; delete the entry to bring one back.

## 2. Internal runs

`docs/internal.html` and friends — sign-in gated on the live site.

| Page | What it is |
|---|---|
| `internal.html` | **Scoreboard**: one row per run, one column per game, cell = that run's score |
| `viewer.html` | **Run inspector**: scrub every board state of a game and read the agent's full decision trace per turn |
| `harness.html` | Per-run harness facts (server, weights, env knobs) + real in-code tool-call counts |
| `signals.html` | **Signal runs**: one game played N times, as a box/whisker score distribution |
| `usage.html` | Per-run CPU / GPU / RAM / storage over the life of the run |

Static data from finished runs only — no live streaming. 37 runs are published today.

### The metric, and why we don't trust single runs

Score is the ARC-AGI-3 score (level depth is weighted, so depth beats efficiency).
Two rules, both learned the hard way:

- **Score on ex-`ft09`, never raw all-25.** One game (`ft09`) swings the 25-game average by
  ±1.0 on its own. Its own signal run — 25 passes of the same config — ranges 0.0 to 47.6
  (median 10.8, σ 11.2).
- **The 25-game mean is noise-dominated.** Its ~95% range on a fixed config is roughly
  0.45–2.67, so a single-run A/B cannot resolve a harness change. Replicate anything
  promising 2–3×.

### Where things stand

Reference points: Tufa's public-set score with this harness is **1.6002**; their semi-private
milestone score was 1.21. Our pristine reproduction of their stack (`tufa-exact-rung0`) scores
0.679, and that run is the baseline every other run's knobs are diffed against.

Best validated configs, by 2-pass mean ex-`ft09`:

| Config | ex-`ft09` | Note |
|---|---:|---|
| `ffa7gn` — frame-full + ACTION7 + animation + goal-guidance + **no-impact band** | **1.62** | current best; 21 levels |
| `ffa7gnh` — + HUD code-model | 1.60 | flat vs `ffa7gn`; the code model didn't add |
| `frame-full` alone | 1.44 | env-toggle `ARC3_FRAME_MODE=full` |
| `baseline-v12` (frozen reference) | 1.21 | 2 runs: 1.224, 1.188 |
| `ffa7g` — same stack, **no** no-impact band | 1.05 | the ablation control |
| `ffa7gnsg` — + state graph | ~1.11 | **regression**, defaulted OFF |

What the ablations actually said:

- **No-impact detection is the one clear win** (+55% ex-`ft09`, 21 vs 15 levels at equal
  action budget). It stops an explore action whose only board change is the game's
  deterministic HUD/moves band, killing wasted wall-presses. Both runs hit the ~132-min time
  cap, so the savings buy *progress*, not a lower action count.
- **The state graph lost three times running.** The model used its tools heavily but the
  plan-rejection block fired zero times, so we paid the query-turn cost (644 vs 366 tok/action)
  for nothing → fewer actions → fewer levels. A lean rerun that surfaces `untried_here` for
  free still lost on a 7-game A/B (1.533 on vs 2.061 off). Now opt-in via `ARC3_STATE_GRAPH=on`.
- **Model swaps all failed.** 35B-A3B MoE: 0.000 across 25 games. GLM-4.6V (SOTA visual
  grounding): 0.000. Gemma-4-31B (AIME 89.2): 0.156. A brevity-RL fine-tune cut thinking
  tokens 46% but the savings didn't convert to actions (1,710 vs 3,073) and depth collapsed.
  The 27B dense remains the harness's brain.
- **Serving matters, but less than tempo.** The vrfai compressed-tensors quant hits a
  pathological kernel path on vLLM 0.25 (3.4× slower than 0.19; ngram spec decode amplifies it
  to unusable), while spec decode on official weights is statistically tied with the pristine
  stack. Our early agent-side modifications (required ledger, outline renders, 900s yield) cost
  ~2.2× on identical serving — the tempo regime (60s yield, act-look-act) dominates everything
  else at this model scale.

### The custom-games pass

`20260726_054336_v12-ffa7gnsg-customgames17` is the first harness run against the **17 in-house
custom games** instead of the official 25, using the validated-best config. Mean 7.89 over 17
games, 24 levels, all completed without a crash. One outright win: `ps01` (Pouring Water Son, a
*live* real-time physics game) cleared its only level — the first evidence this turn-based
harness can handle continuous game semantics at all. Best partials: `cr01` (Crumbling Route)
9/10 levels, `sn02` (Sneeze) 6/7.

These numbers are **not comparable** to any all-25 or ex-`ft09` figure above: different games,
different level counts, different baselines (several needed `baseline_actions` patched to null
first — see `scripts/build_gcp_customgames_bundle.py`).

### Publishing a run

```bash
scripts/publish_run.sh <gcs-run-id> <log-dir-name>
```

This is the single supported submission path. It pulls logs from GCS, exports the viewer and
execution trace, validates the final score against the timestamped score curve, then uploads one
hash-verified archive to the versioned Railway publication API. The API installs the run files
and commits the run, per-game scores, score events, artifact hashes, and publication receipt to
Railway Postgres in one transaction with filesystem rollback.
Every publication must include `LAUNCH_STATE.json` or `model-info.json` with the exact model
repository and full 40-character revision. The exporter cross-checks both files when both exist,
stores their SHA-256 evidence in the catalog, and refuses an unlabelled or unpinned upload.
The scoreboard and both score-over-time pages read that database-backed catalog, so there is
no separate index upload to remember. Publishing data never changes Git and never triggers a
Railway deployment. The publisher reads `ARC3_PUBLISH_TOKEN` from the environment or, when run
from an authorized machine, from the linked `arc3-viewer` Railway service. Set `$ARC3_SITE_DIR`
only when the current checkout is not Railway-linked.

`scripts/publish_railway_data.py` refuses to overwrite an existing run by default. A deliberate
re-export must pass `--replace`; it first reads the current manifest and uses an optimistic
precondition, so a stale task cannot overwrite a newer publication. The replaced directory is
retained under `/srv/data/.rollback/`.
If the Postgres transaction fails, the newly installed directory is moved to `/srv/data/.failed/`
and the prior volume copy is restored. Raw artifacts remain canonical in GCS.

The Railway image is built from the root `Dockerfile`. It contains the site shell, game assets,
and the catalog/publication API. Run metadata lives in Railway Postgres; large immutable viewer
and trace payloads live under `/srv/data`. `docs/data/`, `logs/`, and experiment work directories
remain excluded from the image and from new Git commits.
Deploy code only when the shell or API changes. Ordinary trace publication uses the API and does
not run `railway up`; the volume is mounted independently and is not rebuilt or copied during an
image deployment.

Supporting exporters: `export_viewer_data.py` (per-turn frames), `export_signal_runs.py`,
`export_usage.py`, `export_tool_calls.py`, `export_game_thumbs.py`.

## Harness variants

The rule that keeps `main` from drifting away from a known-good baseline:
**the baseline is an immutable artifact; experiments copy from it and never edit it in place.**

- `harnesses/baseline-v12/` is **frozen** — the exact source the `bundle-v12` GCS artifact runs
  (which is not any clean git commit, so this vendored copy is the only faithful record).
- A variant = copy of `baseline-v12` + its own patch → its own new-named bundle. Never mutate
  the baseline, never overwrite a shared GCS bundle.
- Small/additive and sharing the agent loop → an env-toggle stored as `patch/` + `MANIFEST.md`.
  Fundamentally different code (a two-agent world-model harness) → its own folder.
- Every folder carries a `MANIFEST.md`: what it derives from, the diff, env config, and its
  validated ex-`ft09` score(s).

See `harnesses/README.md`.

tufa-arc-agi-framework/, vendor-taaf-grafts/   upstream framework + our grafts
gcp/             spot-safe launch kit: restartable runs, GCS log sync, crash-loop guards,
                 one startup script per harness variant

```

Big raw request logs (`*_requests.jsonl`, multi-GB for thinking runs) live in
`gs://cellens-ai-artifacts/arc3-duck/` rather than git; a424-run request logs are included
gzipped.

## Provenance

The harness is a working fork of [Tufa Labs' ARC-AGI-3 Duck Harness](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jeroencottaar/tufa-labs-duck-harness-june-30-milestone-winner)
(June 30 milestone winner) by Harold Bessis, Jeroen Cottaar, Isaiah Pressman, Andries Smit,
Michal Tesnar and Stefano Viel, MIT-licensed. Commit `a2dddac` is pristine upstream; every
divergence since is one reviewed commit. Competition environment files are not redistributed
