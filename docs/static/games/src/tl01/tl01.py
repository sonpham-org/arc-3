# PURPOSE: tl01 "Toll" -- an ARC-AGI-3 environment in which every gate is paid for with one
#   of the player's own four actions, permanently for the level. The walker is drawn with four
#   limbs, one per direction. Standing on a booth, the next direction pressed does not move
#   the walker: that limb detaches, lodges in the booth, the booth opens, and the direction is
#   gone until the level ends. Later booths and the corridor itself need directions too, so
#   the puzzle is choosing which limb you can live without. Shaped booths only open for one
#   limb. There is no budget, no lives and no counter anywhere on screen -- the body is the
#   whole display of state, and the level ends the moment the exit stops being reachable with
#   the limbs that are left. Core-knowledge priors only: objectness, topology, agentness.
# SRP/DRY check: Pass -- self-contained environment. No game in the catalogue removes actions
#   from the action set as a cost, so there is no prior art to reuse.
"""Toll -- pass gates by giving up your own actions.

ACTION1/2/3/4 move up/down/left/right. On an unpaid booth the next press does not move you:
the limb for that direction detaches and lodges in the booth, which opens, and that direction
does nothing for the rest of the level. A shaped booth only opens for the limb its socket is
cut for; any other offering is lost and the booth stays shut. Reach the exit. When the exit
can no longer be reached with the limbs you still own, the level is over and the body goes
grey. RESET retries the level with a whole body.

7 levels. No RNG. No budget, no lives, no counters.
