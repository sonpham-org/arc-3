"""Composite graft installer — the single notebook cell-12 entry point.

``install(bm, flags)`` is the ONLY thing the kernel calls. Its entire body
runs under one try/except that restores the original ``bm.solver`` object
on ANY error (and reverts any module-global knob patch it applied first),
so a broken graft can never take the run down: the worst case is stock
behaviour with a one-line ``[taaf_grafts] install failed -> stock`` note.

INVARIANTS (why this file is shaped the way it is):

- ALL flags default OFF; ``install(bm, {})`` is a proven no-op (the
  standing all-flags-off byte-identity gate — the 1.15-floor guarantee).
- Flag module imports are individually guarded, so the composite works on
  a dataset version where a flag's module does not exist yet
  (forward-compat): a missing module degrades that one flag to stock, a
  genuine error restores the whole solver to stock.
- ``transfer`` implies ``banking`` (the transfer session subclasses the
  banking session).
- The solver is swapped by ``from_solver`` (a field-copy, not a pickle):
  the subclass survives ``Benchmark.run``'s two deepcopies because
  ``HarnessSolver.__deepcopy__`` reconstructs ``type(self)`` and keeps
  ``analyzer_factory`` by reference.
- ``context_window`` is a MODULE-GLOBAL patch, never an env var: the
  ``LOCAL_ANALYZER_*`` knobs are frozen as module globals at first import
  of ``inference.framework.solver`` (during the cell-10 unpickle), but
  ``_LOCAL_ANALYZER_CONTEXT_WINDOW`` is re-read at every per-game
  ``ToolAgent`` construction, so reassigning the global in cell 12 lands;
  setting the env var then would be too late.
- The stock analyzer factory replicates ``HarnessSolver._make_analyzer``'s
  default branch EXACTLY except ``api_key=base_url=provider=None``: this
  sidesteps the deepcopy-closure ``_local_server_*`` landmine (a closure
  captured pre-deepcopy would read the wrong instance's server fields) by
  letting ``ToolAgent`` env-resolve its connection — which is byte-
  identical to the default branch in the Kaggle reality where
  ``start_local_server`` is off and those fields are empty.
